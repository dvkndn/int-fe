**Version control: Git**

- `why` De facto solution, easy to share and collaborate
- Hosting: GitHub (Personal best)
- Convention: Conventional Commits

**Programming language: TypeScript**

- `why` Best compromise, best dev exp
- `alt` Scala.js: interop cost too high, dev exp too low
- `alt` Reason: syntax quite weird, interop cost too high, React-driven
- `alt` Dart: too immature, Angular-driven
- `alt` JavaScript: too, well, unnecessarily dangerous and not good dev exp
